# portfolio-dux


Hi Filip,

To explain the bug a little better - The navbar still seems to be working correctly however when I click on the 'contact us' button at the bottom of the page the browser's back button stops functioning properly.

The code for that button is located under Components > Shared > ContactContainer.js, the code for the NavBar is still the same as it was from the original portfolio project.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!
Thank you!
